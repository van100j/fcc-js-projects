URL Shortener Microservice 
=====================

[FCC's URL Shortener Microservice project challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/url-shortener-microservice):

1. Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://little-url.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

2. Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.

3. Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

4. User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

5. User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

6. User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

7. Pro Tip: Checkout this [wiki article](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Using-MongoDB-And-Deploying-To-Heroku/) for tips on integrating MongoDB on Heroku.
