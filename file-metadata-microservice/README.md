File Metadata Microservice
=====================

[FCC's File Metadata Microservice project challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/file-metadata-microservice):

1. Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

2. Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.

3. Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

4. User Story: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

5. User Story: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

6. Hint: You may want to use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer

[Demo at Heroku](https://mysterious-brook-98096.herokuapp.com/)
