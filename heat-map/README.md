Visualize Data with a Heat Map 
=====================

[FCC's Visualize Data with a Heat Map project challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map):

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNLYPp/.

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. User Story: I can view a heat map with data represented both on the Y and X axis.

4. User Story: Each cell is colored based its relationship to other data.

5. User Story: I can mouse over a cell in the heat map to get more exact information.

6. Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json
