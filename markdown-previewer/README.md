Build a Markdown Previewer (w/ React)
=====================

[FCC's Build a Markdown Previewer with React project challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer):

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

4. User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

5. Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked

6. Note: If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor
