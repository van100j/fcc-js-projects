Timestamp Microservice
=====================

[FCC's Timestamp Microservice project challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice):

1. Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

2. Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.

3. Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

4. User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

5. User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

6. User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

[Demo at Heroku](https://mighty-ravine-76906.herokuapp.com/)
