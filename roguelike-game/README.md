Build a Roguelike Dungeon Crawler Game (w/ React) 
=====================

[FCC's Build a Roguelike Dungeon Crawler Game with React project challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game):

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/PNJRyd/.

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. User Story: I have health, a level, and a weapon. I can pick up a better weapon. I can pick up health items.

4. User Story: All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.

5. User Story: I can move throughout a map, discovering items.

6. User Story: I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.

7. User Story: Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed.

8. User Story: When I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.

9. User Story: When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I do damage based off of my level and my weapon. The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.

10. User Story: When I find and beat the boss, I win.

11. User Story: The game should be challenging, but theoretically winnable.
