Build a Camper Leaderboard (w/ React) 
=====================

[FCC's Build a Camper Leaderboard with React project challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard):

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/.

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. User Story: I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

4. User Story: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

5. User Story: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

6. Hint: To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent.

7. Hint: To get the top 100 campers of all time: https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime.
