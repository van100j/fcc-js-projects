1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/xVXWag/.

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. User Story: I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.

4. User Story: I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.

5. User Story: I can click into any of those recipes to view it.

6. User Story: I can edit these recipes.

7. User Story: I can delete these recipes.

8. User Story: All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.
