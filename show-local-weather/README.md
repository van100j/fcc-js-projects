Show Local Weather (w/ React)
=====================

[FCC's Show the Local Weather project challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather), built with React:

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: (http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV).

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

4. User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

5. User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

6. We recommend using the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current#geo). This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.
